## What is Competitive Programming ?
Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Several multinational software companies like Google and Facebook host programming competitions on a regular basis.

Such programming competitions involve solving a set of logical or mathematical problems, and contestants are required to write a source code of computer programs to solve the problem. Programs can come from the fields of combinatorics, number theory , graph theory, string analysis and data structures.

## How is it done ?

The process of solving a program can be done by construction an effective algorithm and implementing the algorithm using programming language. In competitive programming most effective programming languages are C/C++ and Java.

1. C++ is very useful in competitive programming because STL , vectors and maps can be used which is instrumental in solving various problems. 
2. Java is also useful because of the buffer library.
3. Python / Ruby are not the best options for competitive programming. 
 
Even though Python is much simpler than other programming languages it should not be used mainly because of two reasons . First the execution of the source code takes longer than C/C++ so the time limit usually exceeds during competitions, Secondly python does not use pointers so memory issues might also arise.

## How do I get started ?

There are many online platforms to help anyone getting started with competitive programming. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is best for starting because of its good user interface. First solve the easy problems and after gaining confidence and knowledge start solving the medium and hard problems. Then make an account in [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com) or [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) and take part in the weekly competitions of codeforces , this will give you a taste of the bigger competitions. Trying the long challenges of codechef is also very useful for developing certain skills. If someone already has some experience with competitive programming then going through a list of algorithms from geeksforgeeks will help you improve your skills.

There are many notable competitions lasting for a few hours. Google organizes three competitions in a year:

* **Google codejam** : competition held from 2003, The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time.
* **Google kickstart** : This is also a competition where participants have to solve three questions in each round , each problem harder than the last one. 
* **Google hashcode** :This competition only requires participants to solve only one optimization problem . Unlike the other two this is a team event where there may be 2-4 participants per team .

You can find out more about these cometitions [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/)


Facebook also organizes the [Facebook Hacker cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/) which started from 2011. 


If any participant wants offers from Google or facebook or any other multinational company then he/she has to do good in any of these competitions and have a good rating in platforms like codeforces or codechef.

Good Luck.
