# Divine Recursors

> “Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse : complexity sells better.” - Edsger Dijkstra

We feel the same way, we are a group of programming enthusiasts from **Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, India**. Most of us are pursing our B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. Divine Recursors is our competitive programming team. In our spare time we discuss data structures, algorithms, puzzles, C++ STL and some other interesting computer science topics.

We participate in various competitive programming competitions and algorithmic challenges. Sharing a common passion
for computers, math and puzzles, we plan to share our learnings, progress and experiences via this blog.
